### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Before We Start

1. Create a Postgresql locally or with any cloud free host account, such as AWS RDS.

### Get connection details via Cloud service

1. Navigate to your RDS cluster's dashboard.
2. Get **Endpoint**, **Port** and **User** field from the Connection tab.
3. Build your DATABASE_URL string: `postgres://<User>:<Password>@<Endpoint>:<Port>/<DB_NAME>?sslaccept=strict`

### Get connection details via docker-compose

1. update the docker-compose.yml file and run the following commands.

```bash
  ## to confirm username on mac
  echo $USER

  # start up
  docker-compose up
```

2. Get **Endpoint**, **Port** and **User** field from the Connection tab.
3. Build your DATABASE_URL string: `postgres://<User>:<Password>@<c@localhost:>:<5432>/<DB_NAME>?sslaccept=strict`

### 2. Deploy on your workspace

1. Clone the code.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/savannahtech/tijani-entro-test.git
   cd tijani-entro-test
   ```

2. Set DATABASE_URL environment variables.
   ```shell
   export DATABASE_URL=${your_DATABASE_URL_string}
   ```
3. Install dependence.

   ```shell
   cd backend
   yarn install

   cd ../frontend
   yarn install
   ```

4. Migrate your database.

   ```
5. Start the app.

   ```shell
   cd ../frontend
   yarn start

   cd ../backend
   yarn start:dev
   ```

6. Run test.
   ```shell
   npm run test:watch
   ```

üéâ Mission Completes.

  <summary><h2>Deploy on Vercel</h2></summary>

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Before We Start

1. Create a [AWS RDS](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/) account and get your free trial cluster.
2. Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) account.

### 1. Get connection details

1. Navigate to your RDS cluster's dashboard.
2. Get **Endpoint**, **Port** and **User** field from the Connection tab.
3. Build your DATABASE_URL string: `postgres://<User>:<Password>@<Endpoint>:<Port>/<db_name>?sslaccept=strict`

You will use this DATABASE_URL string to connect to AWS RDS Cloud cluster later.

### 2. Deploy on Vercel

The **Deploy** button will take you through Vercel's project creation flow. Vercel will help to clone this job to your own GitHub repository and automatically deploy it.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-name=tijani-entro-test&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsavannahtech%2Ftijani-entro-test&env=DATABASE_URL&envDescription=tijani-entro-test%20Cloud%20connection%20string)

1. Click the **Deploy** button.
2. Click **GitHub** button and authenticate GitHub account.
3. Select your **Git Scope** and fill in **Repository Name** for your own GitHub repository.
4. Click **Create** to create the git repository.
5. Enter the DATABASE_URL string, get in the previous step, in the **Value** field.
6. Click **Deploy**.

üéâ Mission Completes.

Now wait for the deployment to complete, then you can view your site on the default domain generated by Vercel.
